OSDetect README
===============

What is OSDetect?
-----------------

OSDetect is a small python module which is able to get some information
about your system and python implementation, like the Operating System
or the hardware platform.

Supported operating systems
---------------------------

As of now, only GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, Windows NT and Windows NT/Cygwin are supported. At the
moment, I'm working on support for a wider range of operating systems.

Note that the information available on the different platforms may differ.

Installation instructions
-------------------------

Since OSDetect uses setuptools, you simply need to run

		setup.py install
